Immediate.Handlers is an implementation of the mediator pattern in .NET using source-generation. All pipeline behaviors
are determined and the call-tree built at compile-time; meaning that all dependencies are enforced via compile-time
safety checks. Behaviors and dependencies are obtained via DI at runtime based on compile-time determined dependencies.

#### Examples
* Minimal Api: [Normal](./samples/Normal)

## Installing Immediate.Handlers

You can install [Immediate.Handlers with NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Immediate.Handlers):

    Install-Package Immediate.Handlers
    
Or via the .NET Core command line interface:

    dotnet add package Immediate.Handlers

Either commands, from Package Manager Console or .NET Core CLI, will download and install Immediate.Handlers.

## Using Immediate.Handlers
### Creating Handlers

Create a Handler by adding the following code:

```cs
[Handler]
public static class GetUsersQuery
{
    public record Query;

    private static ValueTask<IEnumerable<User>> HandleAsync(
        Query _,
        UsersService usersService,
        CancellationToken token)
    {
        return usersService.GetUsers();
    }
}
```

This will automatically create a new class, `GetUsersQuery.Handler`, which encapsulates the following:
* attaching any behaviors defined for all queries in the assembly
* using a class to receive any DI services, such as `UsersService`

Any consumer can now do the following:
```cs
public class Consumer(GetUsersQuery.Handler handler)
{
	public async Task Consumer(CancellationToken token)
	{
		var response = await handler.HandleAsync(new(), token);
		// do something with response
	}
}
```

### Creating Behaviors

Create a behavior by implementing the `Immediate.Handlers.Shared.Behaviors<,>` class, as so:
```cs
public sealed class LoggingBehavior<TRequest, TResponse>(ILogger<LoggingBehavior<TRequest, TResponse>> logger)
	: Behavior<TRequest, TResponse>
{
	public override async ValueTask<TResponse> HandleAsync(TRequest request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
	{
		logger.LogInformation("LoggingBehavior.Enter");
		var response = await Next(request, cancellationToken);
		logger.LogInformation("LoggingBehavior.Exit");
		return response;
	}
}
```

This can be registered assembly-wide using:
```cs
[assembly: Behaviors(
	typeof(LoggingBehavior<,>)
)]
```

or on an individual handler using:
```cs
[Handler]
[Behavior(
	typeof(LoggingBehavior<,>)
)]
public static class GetUsersQuery
{
	// ..
}
```

Once added to the pipeline, the behavior will be called as part of the pipeline to handle a request.

Note: adding a `[Behavior]` attribute to a handler will disregard all assembly-wide behaviors for that handler, so any
global behaviors necessary must be independently added to the handler override behaviors list.

#### Behavior Constraints

A constraint can be added to a behavior by using:
```cs
public sealed class LoggingBehavior<TRequest, TResponse>
	: Behavior<TRequest, TResponse>
	where TRequest : IRequestConstraint
	where TResponse : IResponseConstraint
```

When a pipeline is generated, all potential behaviors are evaluated against the request and response types, and if
either type does not match a given constraint, the behavior is not added to the generated pipeline.

### Registering with `IServiceCollection`

Immediate.Handlers supports `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions` directly. 

#### Registering Handlers

```cs
services.AddHandlers();
```

This registers all classes in the assembly marked with `[Handler]`.

#### Registering Behaviors

```cs
services.AddBehaviors();
```

This registers all behaviors referenced in any `[Behaviors]` attribute.
